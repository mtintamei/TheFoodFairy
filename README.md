# ü•¶ The Food Fairy: Food Distribution Management System

## SDG 2: Zero Hunger

The Food Fairy is a food redistribution application designed to reduce food waste and support the fight against hunger. By bridging the gap between food donors and communities in need, this system ensures that surplus food finds its way to the people who need it most.

## üìÇ Project Structure

### **Backend**
Handles the application's logic and data management.

- **`config/db.js`**: Configures the connection to the MySQL database.
- **Controllers**: Logic for handling requests (e.g., creating, reading, updating, and deleting records).
  - *Examples*: `donorController.js`, `deliveryController.js`.
- **Models**: Defines database schemas for entities like `Donor`, `Beneficiary`, and `Distribution`.
- **Routes**: API endpoints to interact with the system.
  - *Examples*: `/donors`, `/volunteers`.
- **Middleware**: Implements security and authentication.
  - *Example*: `authMiddleware.js`.

### **Frontend**
Handles the user interface and interactions.

- **Notification Styles**: Organized CSS for notifications (`toast.css`, etc.).
- **HTML & JavaScript Files**: Separate pages for different actions like viewing pending donations or recording donations.
- **Dashboard**: An employee dashboard to oversee operations.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/THEFOODFAIRY.git
cd THEFOODFAIRY

### **2. Install Dependencies**
```bash
cd backend
npm install

### **3. Set Up Environment Variables**
Create a .env file in the backend folder:
CopyDB_HOST=your_database_host
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
PORT=5000

### **4. Set Up the Database**
Import the db.sql file in your MySQL database to create the required tables.

### **5. Run the Application**
Start the backend server:
bash
npm start

## üöÄ Open the Frontend
Open the frontend by either:
- Opening the HTML files in the `frontend` directory directly in your browser.
- Deploying the files to a server.
